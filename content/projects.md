## Selected projects

I almost always have some new project going on - You can periodically check [my github](https://github.com/SLaGrave) to see if I have anything new. However, I have a few projects that I've put enough effort into that I want to show off:

 - [Syscript](https://samlagrave.com/syscript) - A small (useless) toy language I wrote to understand interpreters a bit better.
 - [RPG-tools](https://samlagrave.com/rpg-tools) - A set of small tools & games for me to use as I run TTRPG campaigns.
 - [nannou-workspace](https://github.com/SLaGrave/nannou-workspace) - Some generative artwork I've made.
