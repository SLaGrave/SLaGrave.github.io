## Me

I am a programmer with a bachelor's in Computer Science. I spend most of my time writing code in **C++** or **Python**, interacting with **SQL databases**, writing or posting to **REST services**, and advocating for writing better **documentation**. In my free time I have been trying (or have tried) to pick up **Rust**, **Go**, **Haskell**, **BQN**, and tons of other languages.

## My interests

I consider myself a programming language nerd - hence the laundry list of programming languages above. In addition to numerous attempts at learning existing languages, I have also dabbled in creating some as well. Most recently I made a toy esoteric programming language called [syscript](https://samlagrave.com/syscript/) based on only one primary command and a total alphabet of about 5 terms.
